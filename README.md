## Description
This is project #2 for the DWA15 course at Harvard Summer School. This service is written in PHP and provides a simple interface to generate random passwords based on a user's criteria. The project is located on [GitHub](https://github.com/reagan83/s15-p2).

## Specific testing details & credentials
I've included a words.txt dictionary scraped from a library I wrote in gatherwords.php.  That file is a dependency for index.php to run, so if it does not find the user will be redirected to gatherwords.php to be regenerated.
